# TODO ðŸš§

Short Term:

1. Adjust the 'Play Again' button function (currently this button just refreshes the browser page).
2. Maybe somehow communicate that images can be clicked on to view full-screen.
3. Change mouse to a finger point when waiting for onClick.

Long Term:

1. Add regional and/or country rounds
2. Add artist rounds based on a single artist.
3. Add gallery rounds (to play paintings ftom a single art gallery).
4. Calculate and display the average distance score (based on averaging all users' guesses for each painting) for each painting and display this next to the user's score for each round (perhaps only in the results).
5. Difficulty Levels (at the moment I've been picking paintings which I think are easy / have the location in the title).
6. Related to Difficulty Levels - option to play with painting names hidden.
7. Offer 'Street View' views of the modern scenes.
8. Unique URLs for each painting - where you just play that picture and not a game of 5 rounds.
9. Add a slideshow - with an Easter egg cheat code 'slide'
